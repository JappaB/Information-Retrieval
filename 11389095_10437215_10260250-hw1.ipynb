    "On the first experiment ($m = 1$) the chance that the results are significant given that the experiment lacks the power to reject is equal to $\\alpha$. On the second experiment it is equal to $\\alpha * P(\\text{We didn't reject experiment } m-1)$. So\n",

    "#### Bias and unfairness in Interleaving experiments [10 points]\n",
    "Balance interleaving has been shown to be biased in a number of corner cases. An example was given during the lecture with two ranked lists of length 3 being interleaved, and a randomly clicking population of users that resulted in algorithm A winning ⅔ of the time, even though in theory the percentage of wins should be 50% for both algorithms. Can you come up with a situation of two ranked lists of length 3 and a distribution of clicks over them for which Team-draft interleaving is unfair to the better algorithm?\n",

At the beginning and end of the simulations the rankings are made up of mostly 'R' and 'HR' documents so they score high.
