    "TREC Eval computes evaluation scores given two files: ground-truth information regarding relevant documents, named *query relevance* or *qrel*, and a ranking of documents for a set of queries, referred to as a *run*. The *qrel* will be supplied by us and should not be changed. For every retrieval model (or combinations thereof) you will generate a run of the top-1000 documents for every query. The format of the *run* file is as follows:\n",

    "    $query_identifier Q0 $document_identifier $rank_of_document_for_query $query_document_similarity $run_identifier\n",
    "    \n",

    "   * `$query_identifier` is the unique identifier corresponding to a query (usually this follows a sequential numbering).\n",
    "   * `Q0` is a legacy field that you can ignore.\n",
    "   * `$document_identifier` corresponds to the unique identifier of a document (e.g., APXXXXXXX where AP denotes the collection and the Xs correspond to a unique numerical identifier).\n",
    "   * `$rank_of_document_for_query` denotes the rank of the document for the particular query. This field is ignored by TREC Eval and is only maintained for legacy support. The ranks are computed by TREC Eval itself using the `$query_document_similarity` field (see next). However, it remains good practice to correctly compute this field.\n",
    "   * `$query_document_similarity` is a score indicating the similarity between query and document where a higher score denotes greater similarity.\n",
    "   * `$run_identifier` is an identifier of the run. This field is for your own convenience and has no purpose beyond bookkeeping.\n",
    "   \n",
    "For example, say we have two queries: `Q1` and `Q2` and we rank three documents (`DOC1`, `DOC2`, `DOC3`). For query `Q1`, we find the following similarity scores `score(Q1, DOC1) = 1.0`, `score(Q1, DOC2) = 0.5`, `score(Q1, DOC3) = 0.75`; and for `Q2`: `score(Q2, DOC1) = -0.1`, `score(Q2, DOC2) = 1.25`, `score(Q1, DOC3) = 0.0`.

    "    - [Positional Language Models](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/~ylv2/pub/sigir09-plm.pdf) define a language model for each position of a document, and score a document based on the scores of its PLMs. The PLM is estimated based on propagated counts of words within a document through a proximity-based density function, which both captures proximity heuristics and achieves an effect of “soft” passage retrieval. Implement the PLM, all five kernels, but only the Best position strategy to score documents. Use 𝛔 equal to 50, and Dirichlet smoothing with 𝛍 optimized on the validation set (decide how to optimize this value yourself and motivate your decision in the report). **[10 points]**\n",
    "    \n",
    "Implement the above methods and report evaluation measures (on the test set) using the hyper parameter values you optimized on the validation set (also report the values of the hyper parameters). Use TREC Eval to obtain the results and report on `NDCG@10`, Mean Average Precision (`MAP@1000`), `Precision@5` and `Recall@1000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the language models, create plots showing `NDCG@10` with varying values of the parameters. You can do this by chaining small scripts using shell scripting (preferred) or execute trec_eval using Python's `subprocess`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute significance of the results using a [two-tailed paired Student t-test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html) **[5 points]**. Be wary of false rejection of the null hypothesis caused by the [multiple comparisons problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem). There are multiple ways to mitigate this problem and it is up to you to choose one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyse the results by identifying specific queries where different methods succeed or fail and discuss possible reasons that cause these differences. This is *very important* in order to understand how the different retrieval functions behave.\n",

An example on how to integrate Pyndri with Gensim for word2vec can be found [here](https://github.com/cvangysel/pyndri/blob/master/examples/word2vec.py). For the remaining latent vector space models, you will need to implement connector classes (such as `IndriSentences`) by yourself.\n",

You can use the validation set to optimize hyper parameters you see fit; motivate your decisions. In addition, mention clearly how the query/document representations were constructed for each LSM and explain your choices.\n",
